[The Convergence of a Spectral Sequence](http://brianhwang.com/teaching/convergence-of-a-spectral-sequence)

An interactive demonstration of how the terms of a bigraded spectral sequence, supported in the first quadrant, converge with each successive page. Both cohomological and homological spectral sequences are supported.

Originally created in Spring 2019, as a demo to supplement a presentation to an undergrad reading group on local class field theory and group cohomology.
